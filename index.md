## Some projects I worked on...

---

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
[Topic Modeling on customer contacts](/nlp_topic)

**Project description:** From contact transcripts, identify recurring and event-driven causes of customer contact to quickly take action that will improve customer experience and reduce costs associated with unwanted contact volume. In order to achieve this goal, provide a dashboard to allow easy exploration of causes, events, and topics to make it easier to understand reasons and trends regarding customer contact.<img src="images/nlp_topic2.png?raw=true"/>

### Computer Vision
[Car Damage Detector (Instance Segmentation and Image Classification)](/image_car_damage)

**Project description:** Automaticly detect damages on a car image and produce a damage summary report. The goal is to experiment image segmentation with Mask-RCNN to see the potential and the complexity applied to a car damage detection problem.<img src="images/image_car_damage.png?raw=true"/>

---

### Time Series
[Call Center Forecasting](/ts_call_center)

**Project description:** Forecast the number of call offering for the next 30 days and apply ErlangC algorithm on projections to calculate the optimal number of needed resources, each 30 minutes of the day, to optimize the workforce planning.<img src="images/ts_call_center.png?raw=true"/>

[Financial & Actuarial Forecasting](/financial_ts)

**Project description:** Forecast monthly and quarterly financial and actuarial indicators to support strategic planning using time-series decomposition technics.<img src="images/financial_ts.png?raw=true"/>

---

### Survival Analysis
[Customer Churn (Group insurance)](/customer_churn)

**Project description:** For new submissions and renewals, estimate the conditional time to event (churn) to help actuarial decisions.<img src="images/customer_churn2.png?raw=true"/>

[Long-term disability claims duration](/lt_surv)

**Project description:** Estimate the duration of long-term disability claims to support actuarial decisions and to optimize claims management.<img src="images/surv_funcs3.png?raw=true"/>

---

### Association Rules
[Consumption of drugs in health insurance](/sample_page)
<img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>

---

### Anomaly Detection
[Health claims Fraud Detection](/anomaly_fraud)

**Project description:** Highlight anomalous claims and extract data rules to understand them and help improve the overall claim analysis process.<img src="images/anomaly_detect.png?raw=true"/>

---

### Classification
[Optimization of life insurance requirements (Detection of undeclared smokers)](/sample_page)
<img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>

[High cost drug claimants risk profile](/sample_page)
<img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>

[Long-term disability risk profile](/sample_page)
<img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>

[Deterioration of experience](/sample_page)
<img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>
