# Image Recognition
## Car Damage Detector (Instance Segmentation and Image Classification)

**Project description:** Automaticly detect damages on a car picture and produce a damage report. The goal is to experiment image segmentation with Mask-RCNN to see the potential and the complexity applied to a car damage detection problem.

### 1. Data
* Google Car Images (Demo)
* Damages polygons

### 2. Model (Online)
* Mask-RCNN (Instance segmentation of damage)
* VGG-16 (Damage location and severity classification)

### 3. Web Interface
* Deploy an interactive Streamlit application to upload a car picture and produce a damage report using a deployed model api with flask.
